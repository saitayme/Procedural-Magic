# Procedural World Science

A Unity-based procedural world simulation featuring advanced civilization dynamics, storytelling systems, and emergent narrative generation.

## Features

### Core Simulation Systems
- **Civilization Dynamics**: Complex inter-civilizational relationships and interactions
- **Legacy System**: Multi-generational storytelling with family dynasties and historical legacies
- **Cultural Memory**: Civilizations remember and are shaped by their historical experiences
- **Adaptive Personalities**: Dynamic personality systems that evolve based on experiences
- **Mythology Generation**: Procedural myth and folklore creation system
- **Narrative Arc Management**: Automatic story arc detection and progression

### Advanced Storytelling
- **Cultural Memory Buffer**: Tracks significant historical events and their emotional impact
- **Mythology System**: Generates and spreads myths across civilizations
- **Folklore Generation**: Creates culturally relevant tales and stories
- **Narrative Markers**: Advanced storytelling elements like foreshadowing and plot devices
- **Chronicle Reader**: Enhanced event capture and narrative presentation

### Technical Features
- Built with Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack)
- Burst-compiled components for optimal performance
- Entity Component System architecture
- Advanced simulation with 12+ epic event categories

## Event Categories

The simulation recognizes and enhances multiple epic event categories:
- **Heroes**: Legendary leaders and heroic figures
- **Coalition Wars**: Massive alliance conflicts
- **Holy Wars**: Religious conflicts and crusades
- **Betrayals**: Treachery and diplomatic betrayals
- **Civilization Collapses**: The fall of great civilizations
- **Golden Ages**: Periods of prosperity and achievement
- **Disasters**: Natural and supernatural catastrophes
- **Revolutions**: Social and political upheavals
- **Cascading Events**: Chain reactions of major events
- **Spiritual Awakenings**: Religious and philosophical movements
- **Major Discoveries**: Technological and scientific breakthroughs
- **Escalating Conflicts**: Growing tensions and wars

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in Unity (Unity 2022.3 LTS recommended)
2. Load the `Simulation` scene
3. Press Play to start the procedural world simulation
4. Use the Chronicle Reader to view generated events and stories

## Development

This project uses:
- Unity DOTS for high-performance simulation
- Burst Compiler for optimized code execution
- Entity Component System for modular architecture
- Custom storytelling and narrative systems
